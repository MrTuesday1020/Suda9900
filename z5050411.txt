Week2:

The aim of week2 is to select our project topic. Then brainstorming the themes or design ideas our focus as much as possible and choose some more reasonable one for application. We have discussed these three topics. For our final decision of the topic, we want to choose topic3. This is because we are all familiar with the skills related to this topic. And we would like to make it greater to create some new function as innovation from our knowledge. For the first two topics, it is hard for us to control the theory. We have already understand some knowledge related to first two topic. However, we think we can not do well in them. So finally we choose topic 3.
