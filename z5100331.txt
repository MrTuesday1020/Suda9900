Week2

7.31 tues

Group formed 
Create account of Trello 
Mainly discussed the topic1 try to find out appropriate ways to implement the requirement.
We list multiple ideas and think about what this idea needs and what other peopleâ€™s opinion about this idea.
However we discussed for a long time still cannot find a good method to do that which can both both meet the requirement and our skill limit.
Therefore, unfortunately we have to give up using topic 1


8.30 Wednesday

We started first group meeting
Discuss two topics because we have already give up using topic 1
Firstly, we try to understand the requirement of each topic and
Try to figure out the hard part of each topic. During this period we talking with each other share opinions.
Then we started to think if we choose this topic all the ideas that we can have to implement this topic.
Discussing with group mates and try to figure out each steps of these ideas then we can know that will we willing to write this idea or not.
